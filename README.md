Personal and business website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

Initially a one page website for years, I'm moving to create a more encompassing online presence for myself and my business :computer:

###Areas

* Homepage
  * Overview and links
  * Personal page with business area separate

* Business
  * Links to FB etc
  * "Packages" overview


TODO
- [x] release initial style changes to homepage
- [ ] business pages
- [ ] update online links
